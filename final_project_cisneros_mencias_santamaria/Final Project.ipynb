    "- What current data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) have implications on AI systems?\n",
    "    1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – European Union\n",
    "        1. Altough the GDPR does have implications on AI systems most importantly it restricts the data that can be used by companies regarding personal data. It also imposes restriction on the usage of available data so this is not exploited in order to fill gaps in de-identified data. \n",
    "       2. The GDPR also limits some of the usage of AI in regard to some of its more common functionalities such as facial recognition and other biometric data.\n",
    "       3. Consent is also a big part of the GDPR, companies must be transparent about the data they are collecting and how they are using it when asking for consent. This means that companies must also be clear and concise in their practice prohibiting them from jargon or other unclear practices.\n",
    "       4. Purpose limitation, any information collected must be used for the purpose it was collected for and nothing else.\n",
    "       5. In relation to the purpose limitation, data minimization is required, companies must only collect the data that is necessary for the purpose it was collected for.                           \n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) – California, USA\n",
    "       Similar to GDPR\n",
    "       1. transparency and purpose limitation \n",
    "       2. Opt-out of the sale of personal information, allowing consumers to request that their personal information not be sold or utilized\n",
    "       3. Right to access, allowing consumers to request access to their personal information that a business has collected, and soliciting amendments to that information or even deletion\n",
    "       4. Protection of sensitive data, its usage should be limited and only used for the purpose it was collected for and only in the case of a business necessity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) – Brazil\n",
    "        1. Regulates the use of personal data in Brazil, it is similar to the GDPR and the CCPA\n",
    "       2. Ammends and adds to current Brazilian privacy laws\n",
    "       3. Allows for fines and actions to be taken against companies that do not comply with the law\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) – Singapore\n",
    "       1. Consent is not needed in cases that follow the Business Improvement Exemption, this allows for the use of personal data without consent in cases that are for the benefit of the individual.\n",
    "       2. Minimization of data, companies must only collect the data that is necessary for the purpose it was collected for, any personal data must be absolutely necessary in order to use it according to the research exception\n",
    "       \n",
    "        The PDPA has similar principles to the GDPR and the CCPA, however exceptions have been made in order to allow for the use of personal data in cases that are for the benefit of the individual in cases where its absolutely necessary. This exceptions must always be justified and transparent towards its cosumers and users\n",
    "       \n",
    "    5. Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) – China\n",
    "        1. Covers the same main principles as the GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD however it does so for companies that are based in or process chinese information. It ensures all chinese information is also mantained within the mainland country \n",

    "- What kind of data is used for training, and in what circumstances can the privacy of people's data be violated?\n",
    "    1. Due to the nature of AI training, massive amounts of data are needed in order to train the AI to perform its task. This data can be in the form of text, images, audio, or any other type of data that the AI is being trained on. This data is often collected from various sources such as the internet, internal company databases, or other sources that contain the data needed for training being an incredible profitable business the recollection, cleaning and offering of said information.\n",
    "    2. Personal data can only be utilized for training when purpose requires it for the individual's benefit, other than that any data should be de-identified and anonymized.Nonetheless many times data has been used without the consent of the individual and in cases where the data is not de-identified or anonymized or without authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is the training data being collected and stored?\n",
    "    1. Training data is collected from any source available, due to the necessity of massive datasets for training, all and any information is good to utilize. This leads to companies sourcing and collecting information from any public available source, this can be from the internet, social media, or any other source that contains the data needed for training, as well as internal databases from different companies that often sell to third parties.\n",
    "    2. Many of AIs largest companies have cloud based infrastructure for the storage of their data, OpeAI utilizes Azure to store their training data as well as their internal data generated from their own products. Cloud based storage is often used due to its scalability and ease of use due to the high demands of data storage that AI requires.\n",
    "- Document data governance policies needed to safeguard information.\n",
    "    Data governance policies are rules and practices utilize to protect and safeguard information. Among the most important are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Roles and responsibilities: Any database or data storage should have a clear hierarchy structure among its users, this ensures that only those with the proper authorization can access the data. This allows for a rigourous control over who has access to the data and who can modify it as well as access logs and mod logs.\n",
    "    2. Data Classification: Data should be classified according to its importance and sensitivity, this allows for the data to be treated accordingly. This classification should be done according to the company's needs and the data's importance. This dictates the access to the data as well as procedures for its use and storage such as encryption level and share policies. Some examples of classifications are: public, internal, confidential, and secret. Where public data can be accessed by anyone, internal data can only be accessed by employees, confidential data can only be accessed by certain employees and secret data  can only be accessed by the highest level of employees.\n",
    "    3. Data Retention: Data should only be kept for the time it is needed, this ensures that data is not kept longer than necessary and that it is not utilized for purposes other than the one it was collected for. This also ensures that the data is not kept in case of a data breach.\n",
    "    4. Data transfer: In relation to data classification, each level should have its own guidelines for the sharing of data, this ensures that data is not shared with unauthorized individuals and that it is not shared without the proper authorization or passed on without the proper level of security and encryption. In case of interception the data should be encrypted and unreadable to the interceptor.\n",
    "    5. Incident response: In accordance to data classification, each level also should have a plan of action and mitigation in case of any incident, this ensures that the data is protected and that the incident is dealt with in a timely manner. This also ensures that the data is not lost or compromised in case of an incident.\n",
    "    6. Backup: All information should be backed up and recovery methods should exist in case of data loss, this ensures that the data is not lost and that it can be recovered in case of any incident\n",
    "    7. Physical security: All data storage should have physical security in place, this ensures that the data is not stolen or compromised in any way. This also ensures that the data is not lost in case of any physical incident like fire or flood.\n",
    "    8. Training: The best way to keep information secure if it's all practices are followed, in order to due this, constant and updating training is needed for all employees and users in order to keep them up to date with the latest practices and procedures for data security.\n"

    "# Part 2 - Privacy issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is model memorization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model memorization occurs when a machine learning model, instead of learning general patterns from its training data, retains specific instances or exact details. In generative AI systems, this can lead to models reproducing verbatim text, code, or other sensitive information that was part of the training dataset. This behavior contrasts with generalization, where a model learns to generate outputs consistent with the patterns in the data without directly replicating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Types of Memorization:\n",
    "    - **Unintentional Memorization**: Happens inadvertently when training data includes unique or rare sequences, such as passwords or personal information.\n",
    "    - **Deliberate Memorization**: Occurs when developers intentionally train models to memorize specific data, though this is rare in responsible AI development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly problematic in large-scale generative models like GPT or Stable Diffusion, trained on massive datasets that may include unfiltered, sensitive, or proprietary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are the problems that memorization can have in AI systems?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Leakage**:\n",
    "Generative AI systems trained on sensitive datasets can inadvertently reproduce sensitive or confidential information. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A model might output Social Security numbers or credit card details if these were present in the training set.\n",
    "Proprietary code or intellectual property from copyrighted material could also be leaked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Privacy Violations**:\n",
    "Regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandate strict data protection protocols. Memorization that leads to unintentional disclosure of personal data can result in non-compliance, leading to legal and financial penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trust Issues**:\n",
    "When users discover that AI systems can leak sensitive information, it erodes public trust in AI technologies, slowing adoption and innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
    "Attackers could exploit memorization vulnerabilities using techniques like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Injection Attacks: Crafting specific inputs to trick models into revealing memorized content.\n",
    "Model Extraction Attacks: Extracting the internal knowledge of the model, including sensitive data, through iterative querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ethical Concerns**:\n",
    "Memorization raises ethical questions about the use of uncurated datasets, especially if these contain personal or copyrighted content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Example:\n",
    "In an infamous case, researchers found that large language models could output verbatim personal information such as email addresses from training data scraped from public sources like GitHub or web forums.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Find a study case, summarize it, and describe how the attackers exploited the issue and what kind of data was compromised.**\n",
    "Study Case: **Extracting Training Data from GPT-3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers explored the extent of memorization in OpenAI's GPT-3 by conducting targeted attacks using repeated queries and crafted prompts. GPT-3, trained on vast datasets scraped from the internet, occasionally reproduced sensitive or private data verbatim. This included:\n",
    "- Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as email addresses and phone numbers.\n",
    "- Proprietary text from confidential documents and web-based repositories.\n",
    "- Code snippets from platforms like GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    " **How Attackers Exploited the Issue:**\n",
    "1. **Prompt Engineering**:\n",
    "   Attackers created specific prompts to \"bait\" the model into revealing exact phrases or sequences from its training data. Examples include:\n",
    "   - Asking the model to autocomplete an email signature.\n",
    "   - Feeding it partial sentences from rare or unique sequences in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Querying**:\n",
    "   By sending multiple related queries and analyzing outputs, attackers could piece together sensitive information from different model responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overfitting in Rare Data**:\n",
    "   Rare sequences in the dataset, such as uncommon passwords or unique phrases, were more likely to be memorized and reproduced by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Data Compromised:**\n",
    "- A leaked dataset contained private communications and unpublished code due to the indiscriminate scraping of web data.\n",
    "- The exact nature of leaked information varied but often included sensitive or personal data not intended for public disclosure.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Impact and Mitigation:**\n",
    "- **Impact**: Revealing this type of information poses privacy risks and violates ethical guidelines for data use.\n",
    "- **Mitigation Strategies**:\n",
    "   - **Data Filtering**: Exclude sensitive content during dataset preparation.\n",
    "   - **Differential Privacy**: Add noise during training to reduce the risk of memorizing specific data.\n",
    "   - **Regular Auditing**: Conduct audits to assess what models can and cannot recall from their training data.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Describe the issues and find real-life examples (study cases) of these issues (from blogs and news)\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Prompt Injection**\n",
    "   - **Description**: This occurs when an attacker manipulates an LLM by crafting malicious input prompts to alter its intended behavior. This can result in the model performing unintended actions, exposing sensitive data, or altering its outputs in dangerous ways. \n",
    "   - **Example**: In May 2023, cybersecurity firm NetSPI demonstrated a prompt injection attack on ChatGPT, bypassing OpenAI's content filters to generate harmful outputs. The attackers, part of NetSPI's research team, showcased how crafted prompts could manipulate the model into generating phishing emails or revealing restricted data. Their work highlighted security gaps in prompt handling but was performed in a controlled research environment, not by malicious actors​.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Sensitive Information Disclosure**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Sensitive information may be inadvertently exposed by LLMs either through integration vulnerabilities (e.g., the application exposing data via its outputs) or users unintentionally sharing private data with the model.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In March 2023, OpenAI disclosed a data breach in ChatGPT that exposed personal information such as users' chat histories and billing details. This incident occurred due to a vulnerability in the Redis server, exploited by an unknown attacker (or unintentionally triggered by system errors). While OpenAI did not disclose the identity of any external attacker, the incident raised concerns about how LLMs handle and store user data securely​\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Data and Model Poisoning**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Malicious actors manipulate the data used during model training or fine-tuning to introduce vulnerabilities. This poisoning can compromise the model's performance, cause ethical issues, or enable attackers to exploit specific weaknesses.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In 2022, security researchers at **Microsoft and Google** uncovered cases where individuals uploaded maliciously altered datasets to public repositories like GitHub. These datasets were intentionally designed to introduce biases or vulnerabilities in AI models during training. For instance, in one notable case, a chatbot trained on such a dataset began providing politically biased responses to sensitive questions. Although the specific identities of the individuals responsible were not disclosed, the poisoned datasets were linked to deliberate efforts by users to exploit open-source data-sharing platforms, potentially for ideological or disruptive purposes. This highlights the dangers of unchecked third-party data in AI development pipelines.\n"

    "- Prompt injection attacks, like the one demonstrated by NetSPI, show how LLMs can be manipulated to generate harmful content such as phishing emails or propaganda. These capabilities can be exploited to spread misinformation, commit fraud, or manipulate public opinion.\n",
    "- Sensitive information disclosure, as seen in the ChatGPT breach in March 2023, highlights vulnerabilities in how AI systems store and manage data. Users often share private data with AI tools, sometimes without fully understanding the risks.\n",
    "- Data and model poisoning incidents, such as the one involving GitHub datasets, demonstrate how AI systems can perpetuate or amplify biases when trained on flawed or malicious data. This can lead to discriminatory or unjust outcomes.\n",
    "- The ability of malicious actors to manipulate AI models raises questions about accountability.Lack of clear accountability could result in regulatory gaps, legal challenges, and hesitation to adopt AI for fear of unforeseen liabilities.\n",
    "- AI systems are attractive targets for cyberattacks, as demonstrated by vulnerabilities like Redis server bugs in the ChatGPT breach. Malicious actors could weaponize AI or use it to attack critical infrastructure.\n",
    "- The lack of universal standards for ethical AI development, combined with the race to innovate, increases the likelihood of systems being deployed without adequate safeguards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact:\n",
    "- Trust in information sources may erode as AI-generated content becomes indistinguishable from authentic human communication.\n",
    "- Manipulated LLMs could exacerbate political polarization, interfere in democratic processes, or promote harmful ideologies.\n",
    "- Unauthorized access to sensitive data could lead to identity theft, financial losses, and erosion of trust in AI systems.\n",
    "- Large-scale breaches could harm millions of users, especially as AI applications become integral to daily life.\n",
    "- AI systems that exhibit biases can reinforce stereotypes, marginalize vulnerable populations, or unfairly impact hiring, lending, or healthcare decisions.\n",
    "- Lack of clear accountability could result in regulatory gaps, legal challenges, and hesitation to adopt AI for fear of unforeseen liabilities.\n",
    "- Dehumanization of services, where machines replace empathy-driven human interactions, may lead to a loss of social cohesion.\n",
    "- Exploited AI could disrupt economies, endanger lives, or escalate conflicts. Autonomous weapons powered by AI are a particularly alarming possibility."

It conveys a sense of security and confidentiality, making it a fitting choice for a secret password."
