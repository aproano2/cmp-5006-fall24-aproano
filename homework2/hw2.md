# Assignment: Cryptographic Hash Functions and Secure Communication Design

## Overview 

In this assignment, you will explore cryptographic hash functions and design a secure communication system implementing various cryptographic concepts covered in class. 

## Part 1: Research on Cryptographic Hash Functions 

### Research Topics Investigate and document the following aspects: 

#### 1. Fundamentals Research Questions: 
- What are cryptographic hash functions? 
- What are the main properties of cryptographic hash functions? 
- Pre-image resistance 
- Second pre-image resistance 
- Collision resistance 
- How do these properties contribute to security? 

#### 2. Common Hash Functions Research Questions: 
- What are the most commonly used hash functions? 
- What are the differences between MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 family? 
- Why have some hash functions been deprecated? 
- What makes SHA-3 different from previous hash functions? 

#### 3. Applications Research Questions: 
- How are hash functions used in digital signatures? 
- What role do hash functions play in password storage? 
- How are hash functions used in blockchain technology? 
- What is a HMAC and why is it important? 

### Deliverable: 
- A comprehensive report (1500-2000 words) addressing the research questions 
- Include relevant examples and use cases 
- Cite reliable sources 

## Part 2: Secure Communication System Design 

### Design Requirements 
Create a design document for a secure communication system between two parties (Alice and Bob) that ensures: 
- Confidentiality 
- Integrity 
- Authenticity 
- Non-repudiation 

### System Components 
#### 1. Key Management Design considerations: 
- How will keys be generated? 
- How will keys be exchanged? 
- How will keys be stored? 
- How often should keys be rotated? 

#### 2. Message Flow Design: 
- Step-by-step message encryption process 
- Step-by-step message decryption process 
- Error handling procedures 
- Session management 

#### 3. Security Features Include: 
- Digital signatures 
- Message integrity checks 
- Replay attack prevention 
- Perfect forward secrecy (optional)


### Deliverables 
Design Document including: 
- System architecture 
- Flow diagrams 
- Security analysis 
- Implementation considerations 
- Potential vulnerabilities and mitigations
