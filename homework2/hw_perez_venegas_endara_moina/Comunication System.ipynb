    "### Components\n",
    "1. Key Management System (KMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Manages the creation, exchange, storage, and rotation of cryptographic keys.  \n",
    "    Responsibilities:\n",
    "- RSA Key Generation: Generates RSA key pairs (public and private keys) for both Alice and Bob. These keys are used for session key encryption and digital signatures.\n",
    "- Session Key Generation: Creates a unique AES session key for each communication session. This AES key is used to encrypt the actual message content.\n",
    "- Key Exchange Management: Handles the secure exchange of public keys and encrypted session keys.\n",
    "- Key Storage and Rotation: Stores the private RSA keys securely and rotates session keys for each new communication session.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encryption and Decryption Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Handles encryption and decryption of messages and session keys to ensure message confidentiality.  \n",
    "    Responsibilities:\n",
    "- Message Encryption: Encrypts the message content using the AES session key. AES provides fast and secure symmetric encryption for the message body.\n",
    "- Session Key Encryption: Encrypts the AES session key with the recipient’s RSA public key to ensure only the recipient can access the session key.\n",
    "- Message Decryption: Decrypts the AES-encrypted message using the decrypted session key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Message Verification Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Verifies the integrity and authenticity of each message.  \n",
    "Responsibilities:\n",
    "- Hashing: Creates a SHA-256 hash of the encrypted message to produce a unique message digest.\n",
    "- Digital Signature: Uses RSA to sign the hash of the message, enabling the recipient to verify that the message was indeed sent by the expected sender.\n",
    "- Signature Verification: On the recipient’s side, verifies the sender’s digital signature using their public key, confirming that the message hasn’t been altered and originated from the authentic sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocols\n",
    "1. RSA for Key Exchange and Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: RSA is used both for securely exchanging the session key and for signing the message to ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.\n",
    "- Application: \n",
    "    - Key Exchange: Alice encrypts the AES session key using Bob’s RSA public key, which only Bob can decrypt with his private key.\n",
    "    - Digital Signature: Alice signs the message hash with her RSA private key, allowing Bob to authenticate her identity and verify message integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AES for Message Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: AES is used as a symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt the actual message content, ensuring confidentiality.\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "    - Alice encrypts her message using the AES session key, providing fast and efficient encryption.\n",
    "    - Only Bob, after decrypting the AES session key, can decrypt the message content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SHA-256 for Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: SHA-256 generates a unique hash for each message, ensuring integrity by detecting any modifications to the message.\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "    - Before signing, Alice creates a SHA-256 hash of the encrypted message. This hash serves as a unique “fingerprint” of the message content.\n",
    "    - Bob computes the hash of the received message and compares it to the hash extracted from the signature. If the hashes match, the message integrity is confirmed."

    "#### Session Management\n",
    "Session Key Management: \n",
    "- Each communication session uses a unique AES session key, which is discarded at the end of the session.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "Long Sessions:  \n",
